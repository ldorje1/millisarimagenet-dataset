## MilliSARImageNet Dataset

This repository provides a reference to the MilliSARImageNet dataset introduced in our paper “MilliSARImageNet: A 2D SAR Image Dataset for Deep Learning Applications.”

MilliSARImageNet is, to the best of our knowledge, the first 2D synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image dataset designed specifically for deep learning applications in near-field mmWave imaging. It includes both synthetic and real measured SAR images of 10 object classes, generated under diverse imaging conditions. We plan to continue updating the dataset with additional real experimental data.
